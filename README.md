# CanadaCountdown

Countdown timer for my Canada trip!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Built With

* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Create React apps with no build configuration.

## Contributing

As I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach
for all the projects out there. If you have any ideas, just
[open an issue](https://github.com/qcarpentier/canada-countdown/issues/new) and tell me what you think.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as
you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
